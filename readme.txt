The attached program can correctly tackle all the tasks set in the coursework, apart from double conversion.
It checks if the input is valid and can convert both from binary to decimal and vice-versa. Input can be either simple for structured with multiple values.
There are multiple tests made for each function that has been used.
The solution I found for the task was using a queue to efficiently store each input type and its corresponding values, and then emptying the queue one by one while converting the values it contains.
